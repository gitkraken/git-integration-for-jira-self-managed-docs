#### Customize Your View Across Projects, Epics, and Sprints

Team Insights for Jira aims to improve your workflows and provide you with the data you need to put you on the right track. View the timeline by Epics, Issues and Sub-tasks and filter by project, sprint, team members, issue status, and more. When managing your tasks, it's important to have the ability to sort them based on different criteria. For example, you can sort tasks by the number of days since the last status update or by the number of commits made.

<div class="bbb-callout bbb--tip">
    <div class="irow">
    <div class="ilogobox">
        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        By utilizing these sorting options, you can gain valuable insights into your workflow. This can help you prioritize and stay organized.

    </div>
</div>

#### Manage Jira Workflows Efficiently

Focus on the Jira issues that matter the most or require immediate attention. Examine multiple Jira issues to see actions performed by users and when they occurred. Easily determine whether tasks are at risk of missing an upcoming deadline or if team members have an excessive workload -- in a more detailed view. Identify stagnant problems, issues that revert in status, or pull requests that remain open for an extended period of time.
Enhance Team Collaboration with TIJ Views

Enable every member of the team and all departments to enhance their understanding by utilizing TIJ views during sprint, epic, and backlog planning. By analyzing the data, individuals can develop the ability to identify recurring patterns, detect trends, and uncover potential areas for enhancement. This process enables them to acquire a thorough comprehension of the entire situation beforehand.

#### Track and Improve Team Productivity

Team Insights for Jira provides a comprehensive view of your team's Jira and Git activity over time. It allows you to easily track what tasks your team is currently working on and monitor their progress. With this information, you can make more informed decisions to improve productivity and efficiency.

TIJ displays Jira activity for all Jira users. Git data such as branches, commits, pull requests, and tags are automatically included in the views if you have the [Git Integration for Jira Cloud](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira) app installed.
