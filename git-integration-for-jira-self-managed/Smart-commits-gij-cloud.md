Smart commits allows your team to perform actions on Jira issues from a single commit. Users can enter the issue key and the desired action such as time tracking or closing an issue.

## Getting started

VERSION 2.6.3+ The smart commit processing is **active by default** and can be enabled/disabled via the git configuration page (![(blue star)](/wiki/s/-1639011364/6452/8b4898d3c114827e64ec143b4fa79bb76a6cfa5b/_/images/icons/emoticons/star_blue.png) **Actions ➜ Edit integration/repository settings**):

_In Jira Server, Smart Commits is a setting toggle in the **Connect wizard** or the git_
_configuration page under **Actions** ➜ **Edit integration/repository settings**._
_In Jira Cloud, this setting is always enabled._

VERSION 2.13.0+ Smart commits support for project keys that has an underscore "\_" character.
VERSION 3.2.0+ Smart commits support for all alphabet characters.
VERSION 3.5.0.2+ Smart commits support for case insensitive smart commits.


Smart commits configuration checklist:

*   **The Jira DVCS Connector Plugin is not required.**
    The Git Integration for Jira app has the functions of the connector plugin plus more integration support and features.

*   **Your Jira e-mail address and Git commit e-mail address matches.**
    The commit author's email should match exactly with a user's email in Jira. If they do not match, the application will add the commit as the app.

*   **E-mail address is not shared by other Jira users.**
    Verify that this email address is used by only one Jira user.

*   **Advanced:** Verify that the workflow conditions and validators are able to process successfully.



The Git Integration app supports smart commit by adding a simple syntax to a commit message.

The basic syntax for a Smart commit message is:

```java
<ISSUE_KEY> <ignored text> #<command> <optional command_params>
```
