## License Types

There are different types of licensing for each Jira instance:

*   Git Integration for Jira Server - **perpetual license** – where it allows for the app to continue working after the maintenance expires.
    
*   Git Integration for Jira Data Center - **subscription license** – where the app will only work during the active subscription period.
    
*   Git Integration for Jira Cloud - **subscription license** - where the app will only work during the active subscription period.
    

## Product Licenses

### Git Integration for Jira Server

Server products and apps are hosted on your servers. This app is sold as a perpetual license, and the purchase price includes 12 months of maintenance (support and version updates).

You can [renew maintenance](https://www.atlassian.com/purchase/renew) for 12/24 months at 50% of the current purchase price. You can [upgrade](https://www.atlassian.com/purchase/upgrade) the tier of your Atlassian product and app licenses at any time. Upgrade prices are calculated based on Atlassian's formula ([view example](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/jira-software#serverlicenses-3)).

If app pricing changes after your initial purchase, there's a 60-day grandfathering period during which you can renew based on the old pricing.

        Atlassian is enforcing changes to Server and Data Center products, including the end of sale for new server licenses on February 2, 2021 and the end of support for server on February 2, 2024. Git Integration for Jira Server will be supported through these dates. Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center platforms are available today for the Git Integration for Jira app.

#### How do I determine my server pricing?

Apps are billed based on the number of users in your Atlassian product:

*   For Jira 7.0 or later, the app tier should match the maximum tier of the licensed Jira products on your instance. For example, if you're running Jira Software (500 users) and Jira Service Management (25 agents) on the same instance, you should purchase the 500-user tier for apps.
    
*   For versions of Jira prior to 7.0, the app tier should match the licensed user tier for Jira. Even if fewer users want to use the app than your Jira license, the two licenses should match exactly.

    <div class="ilogobox">
        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        While this app has features specific to Jira Service Management, the app is technically available across the whole Jira instance. Therefore, the above guidelines for the license tier still apply.

#### Do you offer academic, community, or open-source licenses for server apps?

For server apps, academic licenses are available at a 50% discount if you have an academic license for your Atlassian product.

Community and open-source licenses are available for server apps. [Learn more about community and open source licenses](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-7).

#### Can I extend my free trial?

For server apps, you can extend your app trial up to 5 times - in other words, for up to six months. Extend your trial by generating a new evaluation license key from Atlassian Marketplace. Click **Try it free** and you'll be directed to generate a new license. Paste this license key into the app listing in UPM from your Atlassian product, and you're all set.

#### How can I buy apps for my legacy Jira Server or Confluence Server license?

If you own a legacy Jira Server Unlimited (100+ users) or Confluence Server Unlimited (2000+ users) license purchased in 2012 or earlier, legacy app pricing is no longer available. You have two options for app purchasing:

*   Purchase the app at the non-legacy Unlimited (10000+ users) tier.
    
*   Renew your Jira or Confluence license at a non-legacy tier, then purchase the app at the same tier.

### Git Integration for Jira Data Center

Data Center apps are sold as an annual subscription. You are eligible for support and version updates as long as your subscription is active.

If app pricing changes after your initial purchase, there's a 60-day grandfathering period during which you can renew based on the old pricing.

#### How do I determine my Data Center pricing?

Apps are billed based on the number of users in your Atlassian product:

*   For Jira 7.0 or later, the app tier should match the maximum tier of the licensed Jira products on your instance. For example, if you're running Jira Software (500 users) and Jira Service Management (25 agents) on the same instance, you should purchase the 500-user tier for apps.
    
*   For versions of Jira prior to 7.0, the app tier should match the licensed user tier for Jira. Even if fewer users want to use the app than your Jira license, the two licenses should match exactly.

#### Do you offer academic, community, or open-source licenses for Data Center apps?

For Data Center apps, academic licenses are available at a 50% discount if you have an academic license for your Atlassian product.

Community and open-source licenses are not available for Data Center apps. [Learn more about community and open source licenses](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-7).

#### Can I extend my free trial?

For Data Center apps, you can extend your app trial up to 5 times - in other words, for up to six months. Extend your trial by generating a new evaluation license key from Atlassian Marketplace. Click **Try it free** and you'll be directed to generate a new license. Paste this license key into the app listing in UPM from your Atlassian product, and you're all set.

### Git Integration for Jira Cloud

Cloud apps are sold as a monthly or annual subscription. You are eligible for support and automatic version updates as long as your subscription is active.

When your subscription renews each month, you are automatically billed for apps based on the number of users in your instance.

If app pricing changes after your initial purchase, there's a 60-day grandfathering period during which you can renew based on the old pricing.

#### **How do I determine my cloud pricing?**

Apps are billed based on the number of users in your Atlassian product. Jira Cloud apps are priced based on the maximum users of the Jira products on your instance. For example, if you have Jira Software (50 users) and Jira Service Management (10 agents) on the same instance, you pay the 50-user price for apps.

    <div class="irow">

        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        While this app has features specific to Jira Service Management, the app is technically available across the whole Jira instance. Therefore, the above guidelines for licensing across maximum users still apply.
    </div>
    </div>
</div>

The pricing structure for cloud apps is as follows:

*   Monthly subscriptions with up to 10 Atlassian product users are billed at a flat rate price.
    
*   Monthly subscriptions with more than 10 users are billed per user, starting at the first user.
    
*   Monthly subscriptions with more than 100 users are billed per user. The table above provides example pricing at various user levels.
    

Annual subscriptions may offer a discount depending on the number of users purchased.

#### Do you offer academic, community, or open-source licenses for cloud apps?

Yes. Academic, community, and open source licenses are available to qualifying organizations. See our [Purchasing & Licensing FAQ](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/purchase-licensing#pricing-discounts) for more information.

#### **Can I extend my free trial?**

For cloud apps, you cannot extend your free evaluation period. All cloud apps are immediately subscribed by a user, and we provide a free evaluation period. This is a minimum of 30 days and ends on the second billing cycle after you first subscribe to the app.

## Related questions

### Will the app stop working once it expires?

As with all Jira Data Center licensing, Git Integration for Jira Data Center is a subscription license. The Git Integration for Data Center app will stop working when the license expires.

### Are we able to transfer a license from Jira Server to a Jira Cloud instance upon our migration?

Atlassian currently manages all licenses for the Git Integration for Jira app. Currently, Atlassian is licensing each Jira platform separately. If you have any questions, you can contact Atlassian at [advocates@atlassian.com](mailto:advocates@atlassian.com).

### If transition is not possible, would it be possible for us to receive a pro rata refund when our migration to Jira Cloud is complete?

Regarding upgrades/refunds you should contact Atlassian for this, since they treat them all very differently.

Having said that, Atlassian is inviting customers to migrate to Jira Cloud and they have some licenses for this purpose. Since we sell the application exclusively through the Atlassian Marketplace, you should contact them for more information at [advocates@atlassian.com](mailto:advocates@atlassian.com).
