## Bitbucket Server

End of life support for the latest version, older versions and supported platforms are listed in the [Bitbucket EOL support announcement page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/end-of-support-announcements-for-bitbucket-server-776640855.html).

## Bitbucket Cloud

Atlassian occasionally removes existing features and functions from Bitbucket Cloud in order to provide the best user experience possible. An advanced notice is provided to everyone using a feature before support is ended for that feature. For more information, see [Bitbucket Cloud EOL support announcement](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/view-end-of-support-announcements-for-bitbucket-cloud/).
