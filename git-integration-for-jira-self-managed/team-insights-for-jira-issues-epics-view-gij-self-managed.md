The issue details shows the following information on:

*   who the Jira issue is assigned to
*   which Jira issues the current ticket is waiting on
*   which Jira issues is causing the current ticket to stall
*   what is the current status of the Jira issue

### Sprints view

On the right section of the Issue list is the sprints view which displays the timeline of the sprint. This gives team managers the full picture of the progress of the Jira issues and what's the next step to do. They will also be able to see which Jira issues that needed attention and identify which team members are overloaded with tasks or which work is at risk for an upcoming due date.

The red line indicates today's date. If you drag the timeline scrubber, it changes the Activity date range filter. Hence, it will only show issues that have activity in that time frame. For example, dragging the slider to left lets you take a peek on what was worked on in the past few days or yesterday.

Hover the mouse pointer over the activity bar and it will show details about status changes, and statistics on development changes - for that day. This will display what type of work the team performed on that day.

Click on the **Go to issue** shortcut to take you directly to that Jira issue.

The Epics View tab contains information that helps to organize the rows by epics. This allows team/product managers to easily expand and view the issues within each epic. While it functions closely similar to the Issues tab, it also provides an additional level of organization based on epics.
