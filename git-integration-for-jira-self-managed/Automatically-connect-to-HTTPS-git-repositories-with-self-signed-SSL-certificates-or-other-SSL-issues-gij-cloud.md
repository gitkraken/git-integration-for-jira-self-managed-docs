Perform auto-connect integration with HTTPS git repositories that have self-signed SSL certificates or other SSL issues. For this guide, we will use GitLab as an example:

1.  On your Jira dashboard, go to menu Git ➜ **Manage repositories**.

2.  On the Add new integration panel, click **GitLab**.

3.  For External service, select **GitLab Server (CE/EE) v4**. Support for v3 is deprecated.

4.  Enter the remote URL of the private git server.

5.  Enter Personal access token for this server.

6.  Click **Connect** to continue. If there is an indication of an SSL error, the following screen is displayed.

7.  Click **Ignore certificate errors and continue connection**. This will ignore SSL verification if it's self-signed or expired.

8.  Import the detected repositories and then click **Finish** to complete the setup.
