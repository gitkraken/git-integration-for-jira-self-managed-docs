Introduced in **v2.9.0+** of the Git Integration for Jira app, this feature scans a locally accessible path for cloned Git repositories and automatically imports those Git repository references into Jira. A repository group called FOLDER is added into the Git Integration app repository configuration list.

For a more detailed information about this integration, see [Integration Guide - Adding Tracked Folders](/git-integration-for-jira-self-managed/Tracked-Folders).
