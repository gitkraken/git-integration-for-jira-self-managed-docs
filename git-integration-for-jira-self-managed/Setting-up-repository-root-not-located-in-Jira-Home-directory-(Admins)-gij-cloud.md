There are three possible ways to setup a repository root that is not located in the Jira home directory:

1.  Clone the repository outside of Jira then connect to it via Manage git repositories page ➜ Connect to Git Repository ➜ **Advanced Setup**.

2.  Clone the repository with the standard **Connect to Git Repository** wizard into the Jira home directory.  Soon afterwards, move the cloned repository and update the settings on the repository.

3.  You could symlink the `{$JIRA_HOME}/data/git-plugin` directory to a different volume. The standard **Connect to Git Repository** wizard will still write there, but the data will reside on the different volume. But be aware, that the Git Integration for Jira app treats anything in the `git-plugin` folder as a clone that it owns.
