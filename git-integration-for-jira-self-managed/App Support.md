The Git Integration for Jira app currently supports **Jira** **7.13** to **8.22**!

## Atlassian Support End of Life

**Important changes to Atlassian server and Data Center products**

Atlassian is making changes to the server and Data Center products, including the end of sale for new server licenses on February 2, 2021 and the end of support for server on February 2, 2024. [Learn what this means for you](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/journey-to-cloud)

Starting **v2.13.0+**, we are dropping support for Java 7, Jira 6.3 and 6.4.

## **Retiring IE11 Support**

With the release of the Edge browser since 2015, IE has not been receiving major updates. Atlassian has stated in their [**blog**](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/retiring-ie11-support-for-atlassian-cloud-server-and-data-center-products/) that they will withdraw support for IE11 on all Jira products.

In view of this, BigBrassBand LLC will also follow this decision effectively:

*   For all Atlassian Cloud products, support will end on **31 March 2020**.
    
*   For Atlassian server and data center products, the last version to support IE11 will be released between **September 2019** and **March 2020**.
