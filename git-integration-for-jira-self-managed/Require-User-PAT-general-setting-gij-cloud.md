For detailed information on this feature, see [Documentation: Require user personal access tokens for branch and PR/MR creation](/wiki/spaces/GIJDC/pages/317390849).

VERSION 3.8.1 Git Integration for Jira adds three new settings in the General settings configuration page:

*   Repository Browser

*   Source Code Diff Viewing

*   Require user personal access tokens for branch and PR/MR creation (this page)

When enabled, this setting requires Jira users to configure personal access tokens to allow them to create branches or pull requests from Jira.

The default setting is `Disabled` for new and existing Git Integration for Jira app installations. This setting is retained on restore/upgrade of the app.

If this setting is enabled (_checked_) in General settings, the users are required to setup personal access tokens for the connected repository and to be able to create branches and PR/MR from Jira. This general setting will override the repository and integration settings, regardless if they were set to `OFF`.
