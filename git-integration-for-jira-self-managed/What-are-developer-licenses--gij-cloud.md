Developer licenses are available to existing commercial and academic service license holders who wish to deploy testing and development installations of the Atlassian software. It is provided free of charge and the license maintenance expiration date is the same as your commercial/academic product. This is not available for cloud or server Starter products.

Only the technical contact can generate a developer key from your commercial/academic license.
