<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->

### Problem

Git Integration for Jira application installation fails when using the file upload install method.

### Diagnosis

*   Jira admins will see the installation screen in the Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) a message similar to the one below when installing the Git Integration for Jira app via the [file upload](https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/installing-marketplace-apps-273875715.html#InstallingMarketplaceapps-Installingbyfileupload) method.
*   The "Installing" dialog hangs indefinitely.
*   The error message: "An unexpected error occurred. Refer to the logs for more information." is shown behind the dialog.

### Cause

The Jira system is behind a type of proxy, firewall or network security and the network security/proxy has a limitation on request size.

### Solutions

See the following articles from Atlassian on a resolution:
