Smart commits allows your team to perform actions on Jira issues from a single commit. Users can enter the issue key and the desired action such as time tracking or closing an issue.

## Getting started

The smart commit processing is **active by default** and can be enabled/disabled via the git configuration page &nbsp;<img src='https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/standard/a51a7674-8d5d-4495-a2d2-a67c090f5c3b/32x32/2699.png' width=20 height=20 /> **Actions ➜ Edit integration/repository settings**):

    <i>In Jira Server, Smart Commits is a setting toggle in the **Connect wizard** or the git<br>
    configuration page under <b>Actions</b> ➜ <b>Edit integration/repository settings</b>.<br>
    In Jira Cloud, this setting is always enabled.</i>

Smart commits configuration checklist:

*   **The Jira DVCS Connector Plugin is not required.**
    The Git Integration for Jira app has the functions of the connector plugin plus more integration support and features.

*   **Your Jira e-mail address and Git commit e-mail address matches.**
    The commit author's email should match exactly with a user's email in Jira. If they do not match, the application will add the commit as the app.

*   **E-mail address is not shared by other Jira users.**
    Verify that this email address is used by only one Jira user.

*   **Advanced:** Verify that the workflow conditions and validators are able to process successfully.



The Git Integration app supports smart commit by adding a simple syntax to a commit message.

The basic syntax for a Smart commit message is:

```java
<ISSUE_KEY> <ignored text> #<command> <optional command_params>
```
