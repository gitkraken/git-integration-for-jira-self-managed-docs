The Backlog View is a great tool for tracking work progress and figuring out what needs attention.

&nbsp;

### Introduction

The objective of the Backlog View is to help team/project managers identify work risks before deadlines are missed. This feature is specifically designed to accomplish that goal. It organizes your view into sprints and effectively shows the corresponding issues below those sprints.

So, basically, the Backlog View lets users:

*   See Git repository activity in your Sprint planning view
*   Easily spot issues at risk and adjust plans accordingly
*   Run quicker and more effective standups

&nbsp;

### Getting started

![](/wp-content/uploads/tij-gitcloud-backlog-view-main-screen.png)

On the middle top part of Team Insights for Jira page, click on the Backlog View tab.

The Backlog View organizes issues into sprints, similar to how Epics group issues. This allows you to easily manage your backlog based on the Project filter. Sprints are automatically sorted by rank when the Backlog View is loaded.

&nbsp;

### Activity timeline

On the Activity timeline, you will see the sprint duration representing user activity on a Jira issue spanning in a specific period of days. For example, if you have a two-week sprint, you will see a two weeks worth of work. If you have longer sprints, it will be represented in this section as well.

&nbsp;

### Audit issue activity

In the timeline, you can hover over the activity boxes to view a popup that shows the changes made to the sprint. This feature allows you to keep track of any additions or removals of issues from the sprint, as well as monitor any changes in the status or state of the sprint itself. It serves as an audit window for tracking the progress and modifications within each sprint.

<div class="bbb-callout bbb--tip">
    <div class="irow">
    <div class="ilogobox">
        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        Hovering the mouse pointer over any daily activity will allow you to see what was worked on that day.
    </div>
    </div>
</div>

&nbsp;

### Issue section

On the Issue section, you can expand into the sprint by clicking on the "**\>**" twisty symbol on the left hand side. The activity view for the issues will be displayed, providing insights into both the user activity and the issues themselves.

<div class="bbb-callout bbb--info">
    <div class="irow">
    <div class="ilogobox">
        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        During mouse hover on a row of a Jira issue, the active date period is displayed to the right of the status column.
    </div>
    </div>
</div>

&nbsp;

#### Status column

Mouse over to display the progress status of the activity here. You will see how much percentage of the work is done.

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/tij-gitcloud-backlog-view-show-status-detail.png' style='margin:25px auto;max-width:100%;display:block;' />

&nbsp;

#### Alert symbols

By hovering over these <img src='/wp-content/uploads/bbb-alert-20.png' style='margin:0 3px 0 3px;display:inline-block;' /> alert icons, you can view the calculated progress compared to the expected progress of the chosen issue. This feature let's you analyze the remaining time in your sprint and the number of issues that have been completed or marked as done.

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/tij-gitcloud-backlog-view-show-calc-progress-detail.png' style='margin:25px auto;max-width:100%;display:block;' />

Using the example above, you will see it only has two days left on the sprint. But the calculated progress says it's 18%. This means a low percentage of the issues that were supposed to be completed in this sprint are actually in that percentage of completed or done status.

On a higher level, this gives team/project managers the ability to scan and tell whether if the sprint is on track or have a lot of issues coming to the wire or not gonna make it in time for the sprint.
