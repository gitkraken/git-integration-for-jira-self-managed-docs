<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->

### Problem

Some or all repositories in Azure DevOps integrations are not seen or showing by the integration user.

### Diagnoses

**1\. Permissions**

The connecting Azure DevOps user must have access to the repository to be added to the Git Integration for Jira app.

**2\. Access Level**

Jira admins will notice that some repositories expected in the Azure DevOps integration do not appear in the Git Integration for Jira app. Basic or Visual Studio Professional access is the minimum access level necessary for the Git Integration for Jira app as Code access level is required.

For more information - see Microsoft's article on [Azure DevOps Access Levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels?view=azure-devops).

**3\. Repository format**

Only git format repositories are supported by the Git Integration for Jira app. Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) formatted repositories are not supported.

### Solutions

**1\.  Permissions**

Assign the connecting Azure DevOps user appropriate access to the repository or repositories.

**2\.  Access Level**

Grant at least Basic or Visual Studio Professional access is the minimum access level necessary for the Git Integration for Jira app.

**3\. Repository format**

Convert the Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) formatted repositories to git format repositories
