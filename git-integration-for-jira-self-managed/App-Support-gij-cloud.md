## **Retiring IE11 Support**

With the release of the Edge browser since 2015, IE has not been receiving major updates. Atlassian has stated in their [**blog**](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/retiring-ie11-support-for-atlassian-cloud-server-and-data-center-products/) that they will withdraw support for IE11 on all Jira products.

In view of this, BigBrassBand LLC will also follow this decision effectively:

*   For all Atlassian Cloud products, support will end on **31 March 2020**.

*   For Atlassian server and data center products, the last version to support IE11 will be released between **September 2019** and **March 2020**.
