Atlassian has posted the following relevant information regarding Atlassian Marketplace apps/add-ons and development licenses of JIRA: [https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-4](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-4)

Which points to:

[Licensing and Paid via Atlassian Listings](https://developer.atlassian.com/market/add-on-licensing-for-developers/licensing-and-paid-via-atlassian-listings)

Go to the section titled,Â **"Can customers use developer licenses for my add-on?"**, which has instructions on how to get a developer license for apps/add-ons.

**In summary:**

A developer license can be generated (free of charge) once the plugin has been purchased and can only be installed on a development licensed version of JIRA.
